# FanSpeedTray
System tray app for Linux to control fan speed, monitor brightness and keyboard backlight

# Disclaimer
WARNING!!!: This applet allows manual fan speed control. It does not do any power management based on temperatures. In fact it disables it. This is dangerous. I am not responsible if you burn your laptop. You can use it, but it's at your own risk. I only use it to increase the fan speed when my laptop gets too hot.
